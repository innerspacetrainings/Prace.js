## Configuration file generator

Use this form to generate your configuration file.

### Fields

#### Title, body and branch

You can use regular expressions for the pull requests title, body and branch name. If you add more than one condition to a section, Prace will check that **at least one condition** is met. 
If you want a title to comply with all your conditions, you'll have to write one regex that encapsulates all of them.

If you don't know regex, there are a lot of [good tutorials](https://regexone.com/) out there. You can also test your expressions using an [online tool](https://regex101.com/).

#### Reviewers

You can set how many assignees a review requires, and even specify which users or teams have to be assigned. If at least one of those users or teams is assigned, that check will pass.

#### Labels

For labels you can write any amount you want. If the field is not empty, it will require at least one of the given labels to be in the Pull Request.

The *reviewers* and the *labels* are **not** case sensitive.

#### Additions

You can limit how many additions a Pull Request can have.

All of the configuration fields are optional. Only when the field is given it will be checked. 
(An empty file will make all checks pass).
